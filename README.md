# NLP-Detecting-Bias-On-Climate-Report
## Project Description
NLP technique in detecting bias on climate report. The first phase of this project is data cleaning in NLP such as handling stopwords, removing https, html,
unwanted characters, removing white spaces, split concantenated words and lemmatization. The first phase also includes EDA such as data distribution of 
sentences and words length, frequent words that appear in sentence and words cloud. This will continue to next phase which is feature engineering,
and training the data (Machine Learning/Deep Learning) and before everything else handling imbalance data
